choice
	prompt "Timer frequency"
	default HZ_250
	help
	 Allows the configuration of the timer frequency. It is customary
	 to have the timer interrupt run at 1000 Hz but 100 Hz may be more
	 beneficial for servers and NUMA systems that do not need to have
	 a fast response for user interaction and that may experience bus
	 contention and cacheline bounces as a result of timer interrupts.
	 Note that the timer interrupt occurs on each processor in an SMP
	 environment leading to NR_CPUS * HZ number of timer interrupts
	 per second.


	config HZ_100
		bool "100 HZ"
	help
	  100 Hz is a typical choice for servers, SMP and NUMA systems
	  with lots of processors that may show reduced performance if
	  too many timer interrupts are occurring.

	config HZ_250
		bool "250 HZ"
	help
	 250 Hz is a good compromise choice allowing server performance
	 while also showing good interactive responsiveness even
	 on SMP and NUMA systems. If you are going to be using NTSC video
	 or multimedia, selected 300Hz instead.

	config HZ_300
		bool "300 HZ"
	help
	 300 Hz is a good compromise choice allowing server performance
	 while also showing good interactive responsiveness even
	 on SMP and NUMA systems and exactly dividing by both PAL and
	 NTSC frame rates for video and multimedia work.

	config HZ_500
		bool "500 HZ"
	help
	 500 Hz is a balanced timer frequency. Provides fast interactivity
	 on desktops with good smoothness without increasing CPU power
	 consumption and sacrificing the battery life on laptops.

	config HZ_600
		bool "600 HZ"
	help
	 600 Hz is a balanced timer frequency. Provides fast interactivity
	 on desktops with good smoothness without increasing CPU power
	 consumption and sacrificing the battery life on laptops.

	config HZ_750
		bool "750 HZ"
	help
	 750 Hz is a balanced timer frequency. Provides fast interactivity
	 on desktops with good smoothness without increasing CPU power
	 consumption and sacrificing the battery life on laptops.

	config HZ_833
		bool "833 HZ"
	help
	 833 Hz is the TT alternative to 1000 Hz. Choose 833 Hz
	 if you want a balance between latency and performance.

	config HZ_1000
		bool "1000 HZ"
	help
	 1000 Hz is the preferred choice for desktop systems and other
	 systems requiring fast interactive responses to events.

	config HZ_2400
		bool "2400 HZ"
	help
	 2400 Hz is for very high latency bound systems. Choose 2400 Hz
	 if you don't care about overall throughput or performance, but
	 you care more about latency (some realtime applications) require
	 low latency. The response and interactive processes with 2400 Hz
	 feel much snappier.
